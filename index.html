            <p>I am Hayden, I have lived in Adelaide my entire life. To date I have completed my secondary education as well as Certificate III in Information Technology and Digital Media. I completed a 12-month traineeship in IT and am now employed on a full-time basis as an IT Support Officer. My role mainly consists of engaging with internal employees in troubleshooting and rectifying their IT issues. In my spare time I volunteer for SteamRanger Heritage Railway. SteamRanger is a not-for-profit volunteer run organisation that is dedicated to keeping South Australia’s railway history alive on the ex-Victor Harbor branch line. I am a passenger attendant and am in the process of beginning my training to become a Station Master</a>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span>I have had an interest in IT for as long as I can remember. From a young age I have been fascinated in the advances that technology has taken. I lost touch with my passion for IT during my schooling and didn’t really see myself taking on IT as a career, I didn’t do any IT subjects in school as a result. After I completed year 12 the opportunity arose for me to work in IT, the role kind of fell into my lap to be totally honest! I was sceptical as to whether IT was the right way for me to go, so a 12-month traineeship starting with a certificate level qualification suited me. From there I completed my traineeship and moved into a permanent role. I have never looked back. Working in IT has been a very exciting journey for me, I get to play with new gadgets and look after tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of equipment. To date my main strengths lie in troubleshooting with a basic knowledge of network administration. <o:p></o:p></span>

            <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span>I chose to study with RMIT because I needed to have my studies available in a flexible framework. As I work full time so conventional on-campus study really wouldn’t work for me! After looking through the different courses that were offered through Open Universities Australia the course Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT University seemed to be the best fir for me, so here we are! I chose to further my studies as I want to eventually move into cyber security, perhaps in the police force. <o:p></o:p></span>

                <span>I don’t expect to learn how to do a particular job as a result of completing my first degree level studies. Rather, I am hoping that in doing this study I will gain a good grounding for developing the skills necessary to thrive within the IT industry.&nbsp; I hope that the knowledge and skills that I gain will aid me in being more employable in the fields that I want to move into, such as cyber security. I will need to do further study to lead into the cyber security sector, but I am aiming to lay the groundwork in the first instance. <o:p></o:p></span>

            <span class="image main"><img src="images/jobpic1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            <p>
                This position is that of a Senior Cyber Security Specialist (https://www.seek.com.au/job/38972420?searchrequesttoken=019405c9-40c9-4e0a-b552-2a52eb80e7ea&type=promoted). The position is based around developing this particular company’s cyber security. Using industry standards the position entails ensuring that the company is not vaulnerable to cyber attack. This position is appealing to me because I want to have a technical role in which I am able to see direct results from. Whether that be clients data or intellcitual property. I want a position where I can measure my success and have a common goal that I am continuously working towards. I have always found cyber security to be an interesting concept, so learning the ins and outs of the area would be an exciting opportunity to me!

                This position of Senior Cyber Security Specialist requires experience as well as certifications in penetration testing or ethical hacking. Other prerequisites include 5 years experience in the cyber security industry and direct cyber security certifications such as OSCP, CCNA Cyber OPS, or CompTIA Security+, these all are highly desirable. Personal skills such as time management and excellent communication skills are a must for this position.

                Currently I have roughly 2.5 years experience in the IT industry, primarily in a helpdesk and troubleshooting capacity. I have a brief knowledge of network administration. I currently hold a Ceriificat III in Information technology and Digital Media. I believe that I have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal. I am a very methodical individual and believe that this is one of my greatesty strengths.

                I think that a good place to start towards this goal is to complete my initial study and gain my Bachelor of Information Technology. Form there completing further degrees such as Bachelor of Computer Science would be of benefit. Gaining industry experience would also be a massive benefit, initially in more network adminsistration focused roles, then at some point moving into cyber security. Initially beginning in junior roles, building up my experience to the 5 year mark that is relevant for the role of Senior Cyber Security Specialist.

                    Myers-Briggs results: Advocate – INFJ-T

                    I agree completely with the results of these tests. They aren’t a surprise; they are exactly what I was expecting. I am a visual person and learn in this way.

                    I wouldn’t work in a team by my own choice, however when there is no option, I learn to deal with it. I am a very organised individual and like to be able to keep control. Working in a team doesn’t work well for me in this regard, as I have to relinquish control to other people for different areas. Having to do this might affect how effective I am, however more often than not I learn to deal with it.

                    When forming a team if I knew the individuals that I could choose from, then I would pick the people that I know have the same personality and hope of success that I do. I try my best to work with like-minded people that aim high so that I am easily able to meet my own goals.

                <h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
                &nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span>My project idea is a smartphone application that scans an individual’s online identity and measures how vulnerable they are in the cyber world and in turn gives the individual a rating score. Things such as how much personal information is readily available, how secure their accounts are ranging to the security settings on their social media accounts would be scored. My application would be the independent eye that gives individuals the guidance that is needed in today’s cyber focused world. Popular services such as Google gather information on an individual every time that they search the internet, this allows them to make an accurate picture of you and then they can tailor which advertisements to show you (Smith, 2014). My aim is to highlight how they may be open to this, so that the individual is able to make informed choices every day. <o:p></o:p></span>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span>In this day and age, the amount of information that can be found on an individual online is astounding. My application would be an easy to use place that everyday people with no technical background could input a few key details and in turn let the application come up with its results. The way that the internet is used has changed massively in a relatively short period of time “it was a static network designed to shuttle a small freight of bytes or a short message between two terminals; it was a repository of information where content was published and maintained only by expert coders” (Dentzel, 2013). Oh how times have certainly changed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span>My reason for creating an application is that I think everyone, no matter their awareness or skill level have a right to know how exposed they are online. The internet is a great tool but sharing too much of your personal information can be detrimental in the long run. My aim is to make as many people that I can aware of the dangers that they may face online. “68 percent of people believe they&#39;re doing all they can to protect themselves against cyberattacks”, (Palmer, 2019) – but is this really the case? People are not aware of what is happening in the background of their browser – I aim to point out what the internet knows about them. My proposed application would periodically remind people that their online presence is important – it will prompt them to make regular checks of their online identity. My proposed application would be the useful 3<sup>rd</sup> party that is there to help guide the unsuspecting through what can be a dangerous place. When an individual signs up for 
                    my proposed application, they will be asked to disclose how much they think they are sharing online and how far their security goes. They will be asked what services they are signed up to, this will be from a list of common online services such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Google just to name a few.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span>The application will use this as a starting point and scan these services for the individuals account. From there the application will be able to begin to formulate what kind of an online presence the subscriber has, and scan their accounts for the level of security that they have enabled. For instance, the application will see what kind of information is readily available on their Facebook account, are their photos hidden? Are they able to send a friend request? It is based off of this readily available information that my application will rate the subscriber. The application service will try passwords to try to brute force and crack open the users’ accounts – all of this information will form part of the report that will be generated for the subscriber. <o:p></o:p></span>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span>Dependant on the findings, my application would be designed to give the end user recommendations on fixing the issues that have been found. These will include guides to creating a strong password through to making the most of security settings on social media accounts. <o:p></o:p></span>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span>This will be a mobile application but will also be available as a website. The application will be accessible on all mobile platforms such as iOS and android. Therefore, the main tool used to access this application/software will be a smartphone, followed by any web capable device such as a laptop or desktop PC. The end user will be able to sign up and have an account that they are able to access. Their historical scan data will be available for them to access as well so that they are able to see their progress. I would design the application to send reminders to the end user when a profile can may be needed.

                <p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span>I believe my project may be very complex to formulate. The code will have to tabulate an individual’s online presence – depending on how this is designed it could turn out to be quite complex. In my opinion I think my project idea is quite feasible, but at the moment I lack the skills necessary to complete it, although an experienced web developer/programmer should be able to design the application. My project will not require any specialised hardware, it will be able to run on any mobile device and likewise it will be able to run on the web interface of any computer. <o:p></o:p></span>

                <p class="MsoNormal">
                    <span>If my project is successful it will outline to any individual how exposed they are on the internet. My project will take a snapshot of an individual’s online presence, whether that be social media all the way to online banking. My project will process the information into an easy to read and digest piece of writing. The aim is to make the information readily available and as transparent as possible – let’s face it, you should not have to be a tech wizard to know how exposed you are on the internet and it should be your right to know!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
